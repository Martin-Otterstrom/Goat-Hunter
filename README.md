Download the game on my itch.io site :D: https://5bil.itch.io/goat-hunter

I created all the graphical assets by myself.
I also coded everything by hand in order to learn (that's also why I decided to code the game with pygame and not in a game-cereating-application such as unity etc.
Also avoiding copy + pasting code and stuff from other people's github projects)

I edit the game code inside the 'main.py' file using Pycharm (a code editor for python)

important: 2 files in the main file that I tried importing to this repository couldn't get imported.

1 of the files named '.idea' had a '.gitignore' file in it, so it was 'hidden' when I tried importing it.
Another file 'venv' contained the pygame library aswell as pip and a python.exe file or something. (also some other random liblraries)
This file couldn't make it because it exceded the github file limit. I suggest downloading any library your code editor suggests u need in order to run the code. 

The audio content is free to use and I don't have to credit the makers.
However. I am really really sry that I don't have the possibility to credit the makers of the audio assets. They are very good quality and using them without crediting the
respective creators is sickening to think about. If you are one of the creators of the audio used contact me and I'll sort this out!

Ofcourse I watched ALOT of tutorials in order to create this game (since I had 0 to little knowledge about coding in python before creating this game):

This gentleman introduced me to pygame and his channel is severely underrated, I also tried making pong with pygame using his tutorials!

This gentleman's tutorials had the most influence on my game! I really recommend his channel, especially this playlist:

This gentleman helped me with creating a build revolving the game:
