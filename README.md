Download the game on my itch.io site :D: https://5bil.itch.io/goat-hunter

Yes, It's not responsive. Small screen = whole game does not show, deal with it im a beginner.

I created all the graphical assets by myself.
I also coded everything by hand in order to learn (that's also why I decided to code the game with pygame and not in a game-cereating-application such as unity etc.
Also avoiding copy + pasting code and stuff from other people's github projects)

The audio content is free to use and I don't have to credit the makers.
However. I am really really sry that I don't have the possibility to credit the makers of the audio assets. They are very good quality and using them without crediting the
respective creators is sickening to think about. If you are one of the creators of the audio used contact me and I'll sort this out!

Ofcourse I watched ALOT of tutorials in order to create this game (since I had 0 to little knowledge about coding in python before creating this game):

This gentleman introduced me to pygame and his channel is severely underrated, I also tried making pong with pygame using his tutorials!

This gentleman's tutorials had the most influence on my game! I really recommend his channel, especially this playlist:

This gentleman helped me with creating a build revolving the game:
